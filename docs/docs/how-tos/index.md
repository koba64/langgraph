# How-to Guides

Here you’ll find answers to “How do I...?” types of questions. These guides are **goal-oriented** and concrete; they're meant to help you complete a specific task. For conceptual explanations see the [Conceptual guide](../concepts/index.md). For end-to-end walk-throughs see [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md). For comprehensive descriptions of every class and function see the [API Reference](../reference/index.md).

## LangGraph

### Controllability

LangGraph offers a high level of control over the execution of your graph.

These how-to guides show how to achieve that controllability.

- [How to create branches for parallel execution](branching.ipynb)
- [How to create map-reduce branches for parallel execution](map-reduce.ipynb)
- [How to control graph recursion limit](recursion-limit.ipynb)
- [How to combine control flow and state updates with Command](command.ipynb)

### Persistence

[LangGraph Persistence](../concepts/persistence.md) makes it easy to persist state across graph runs (thread-level persistence) and across threads (cross-thread persistence). These how-to guides show how to add persistence to your graph.

- [How to add thread-level persistence to your graph](persistence.ipynb)
- [How to add thread-level persistence to subgraphs](subgraph-persistence.ipynb)
- [How to add cross-thread persistence to your graph](cross-thread-persistence.ipynb)
- [How to use Postgres checkpointer for persistence](persistence_postgres.ipynb)
- [How to use MongoDB checkpointer for persistence](persistence_mongodb.ipynb)
- [How to create a custom checkpointer using Redis](persistence_redis.ipynb)

### Memory

LangGraph makes it easy to manage conversation [memory](../concepts/memory.md) in your graph. These how-to guides show how to implement different strategies for that.

- [How to manage conversation history](memory/manage-conversation-history.ipynb)
- [How to delete messages](memory/delete-messages.ipynb)
- [How to add summary conversation memory](memory/add-summary-conversation-history.ipynb)
- [How to add long-term memory (cross-thread)](cross-thread-persistence.ipynb)
- [How to use semantic search for long-term memory](memory/semantic-search.ipynb)

### Human-in-the-loop

[Human-in-the-loop](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) functionality allows
you to involve humans in the decision-making process of your graph. These how-to guides show how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows in your graph.


Key workflows:

- [How to wait for user input](human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input.ipynb): A basic example that shows how to implement a human-in-the-loop workflow in your graph using the `interrupt` function.
- [How to review tool calls](human_in_the_loop/review-tool-calls.ipynb): Incorporate human-in-the-loop for reviewing/editing/accepting tool call requests before they executed using the `interrupt` function.
 

Other methods:

- [How to add static breakpoints](human_in_the_loop/breakpoints.ipynb): Use for debugging purposes. For [**human-in-the-loop**](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) workflows, we recommend the [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] instead.
- [How to edit graph state](human_in_the_loop/edit-graph-state.ipynb): Edit graph state using `graph.update_state` method. Use this if implementing a **human-in-the-loop** workflow via **static breakpoints**.
- [How to add dynamic breakpoints with `NodeInterrupt`](human_in_the_loop/dynamic_breakpoints.ipynb): **Not recommended**: Use the [`interrupt` function](../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) instead.

### Time Travel

[Time travel](../concepts/time-travel.md) allows you to replay past actions in your LangGraph application to explore alternative paths and debug issues. These how-to guides show how to use time travel in your graph.

- [How to view and update past graph state](human_in_the_loop/time-travel.ipynb)

### Streaming

[Streaming](../concepts/streaming.md) is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.

- [How to stream full state of your graph](stream-values.ipynb)
- [How to stream state updates of your graph](stream-updates.ipynb)
- [How to stream LLM tokens](streaming-tokens.ipynb)

- [How to configure multiple streaming modes at the same time](stream-multiple.ipynb)
- [How to stream events from within a tool](streaming-events-from-within-tools.ipynb)
- [How to stream events from within a tool without LangChain models](streaming-events-from-within-tools-without-langchain.ipynb)
- [How to stream events from the final node](streaming-from-final-node.ipynb)
- [How to stream from subgraphs](streaming-subgraphs.ipynb)
- [How to disable streaming for models that don't support it](disable-streaming.ipynb)

### Tool calling

[Tool calling](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) is a type of chat model API that accepts tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as part of the output message.

These how-to guides show common patterns for tool calling with LangGraph:

- [How to call tools using ToolNode](tool-calling.ipynb)
- [How to handle tool calling errors](tool-calling-errors.ipynb)
- [How to pass runtime values to tools](pass-run-time-values-to-tools.ipynb)
- [How to pass config to tools](pass-config-to-tools.ipynb)
- [How to update graph state from tools](update-state-from-tools.ipynb)
- [How to handle large numbers of tools](many-tools.ipynb)

### Subgraphs

[Subgraphs](../concepts/low_level.md#subgraphs) allow you to reuse an existing graph from another graph. These how-to guides show how to use subgraphs:

- [How to add and use subgraphs](subgraph.ipynb)
- [How to view and update state in subgraphs](subgraphs-manage-state.ipynb)
- [How to transform inputs and outputs of a subgraph](subgraph-transform-state.ipynb)

### Multi-agent

[Multi-agent systems](../concepts/multi_agent.md) are useful to break down complex LLM applications into multiple agents, each responsible for a different part of the application. These how-to guides show how to implement multi-agent systems in LangGraph:

- [How to implement handoffs between agents](agent-handoffs.ipynb)
- [How to build a multi-agent network](multi-agent-network.ipynb)
- [How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application](multi-agent-multi-turn-convo.ipynb)

See the [multi-agent tutorials](../tutorials/index.md#multi-agent-systems) for implementations of other multi-agent architectures.

### Prebuilt ReAct Agent

The LangGraph [prebuilt ReAct agent](../reference/prebuilt.md#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent) is pre-built implementation of a [tool calling agent](../concepts/agentic_concepts.md#tool-calling-agent).

One of the big benefits of LangGraph is that you can easily create your own agent architectures. So while it's fine to start here to build an agent quickly, we would strongly recommend learning how to build your own agent so that you can take full advantage of LangGraph.

These guides show how to use the prebuilt ReAct agent:

- [How to create a ReAct agent](create-react-agent.ipynb)
- [How to add memory to a ReAct agent](create-react-agent-memory.ipynb)
- [How to add a custom system prompt to a ReAct agent](create-react-agent-system-prompt.ipynb)
- [How to add human-in-the-loop processes to a ReAct agent](create-react-agent-hitl.ipynb)
- [How to create prebuilt ReAct agent from scratch](react-agent-from-scratch.ipynb)
- [How to add semantic search for long-term memory to a ReAct agent](memory/semantic-search.ipynb#using-in-create-react-agent)

## LangGraph Platform

This section includes how-to guides for LangGraph Platform.

LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications in production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.

The LangGraph Platform offers a few different deployment options described in the [deployment options guide](../concepts/deployment_options.md).

!!! tip

    * LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library, which we are committed to maintaining and growing for the community.
    * You can always deploy LangGraph applications on your own infrastructure using the open-source LangGraph project without using LangGraph Platform.

- [How to create cron jobs](../cloud/how-tos/cron_jobs.md)
- [How to create stateless runs](../cloud/how-tos/stateless_runs.md)

### Streaming

Streaming the results of your LLM application is vital for ensuring a good user experience, especially when your graph may call multiple models and take a long time to fully complete a run. Read about how to stream values from your graph in these how to guides:

- [How to stream values](../cloud/how-tos/stream_values.md)
- [How to stream updates](../cloud/how-tos/stream_updates.md)
- [How to stream messages](../cloud/how-tos/stream_messages.md)

- [How to stream in debug mode](../cloud/how-tos/stream_debug.md)
- [How to stream multiple modes](../cloud/how-tos/stream_multiple.md)

### Human-in-the-loop

When designing complex graphs, relying entirely on the LLM for decision-making can be risky, particularly when it involves tools that interact with files, APIs, or databases. These interactions may lead to unintended data access or modifications, depending on the use case. To mitigate these risks, LangGraph allows you to integrate human-in-the-loop behavior, ensuring your LLM applications operate as intended without undesirable outcomes.

- [How to review tool calls](../cloud/how-tos/human_in_the_loop_review_tool_calls.md)

### Double-texting

Graph execution can take a while, and sometimes users may change their mind about the input they wanted to send before their original input has finished running. For example, a user might notice a typo in their original request and will edit the prompt and resend it. Deciding what to do in these cases is important for ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing your graphs from behaving in unexpected ways.
